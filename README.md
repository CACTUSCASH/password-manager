# Password Manager

This repository contains a **minimal command-line password manager** built with
Python. It demonstrates core concepts of cryptography and secure data storage
without relying on external libraries, making it easy to understand and hack
on.

## Features

- Protects all credentials behind a single master password
- Stores service names, usernames, and passwords in an encrypted JSON file
- Derives a cryptographic key from your master password using SHA-256
- Uses XOR encryption to obscure your data (suitable for demonstration,
  *not for production*)
- Includes integrity checking via SHA-256 to detect file tampering
- Simple interactive menu to add, list, and retrieve credentials

## Running the Program

Run the script from your terminal:

```bash
python password_manager.py
```

The first time you run it, it will create a new `passwords.json` file in the
current directory. You'll be prompted for a master password, then you can add
new entries or retrieve existing ones. Make sure to remember your master
passwordâ€”if you forget it, you won't be able to decrypt your stored
credentials.

## Disclaimer

This project is for educational purposes. XOR encryption is **not** secure for
real-world use. To build a production-ready password manager, consider using
established libraries like [`cryptography`](https://cryptography.io/) and
audited data formats such as encrypted SQLite databases.

## Learning objectives

This project showcases:

- Key derivation and symmetric encryption concepts
- Secure input handling with `getpass`
- Data integrity verification using checksums
- JSON serialization for structured storage

It's a strong addition to a cybersecurity portfolio, demonstrating an
understanding of how password managers work under the hood.
